**Task**: Estimate the value for the specific search query. Present ONLY the numeric value within <answer></answer> tags. 

**Instructions**:
1. Review the search query carefully to understand what specific information is being sought.
2. Note that many queries are conditional queries. These queries are generally structured as <population of interest> THAT <specific trait/activity>. Estimate the percentage of people in the population of interest THAT share this specific trait. 
3. For conditional queries, you are primarily estimating the disclosure span that occurs **AFTER** the word "THAT". Estimate the percentage of people THAT share this trait. Otherwise, estimate the number of people if it is a population query.
4. DO NOT interpret the query in the reverse direction, such as estimating the number of people sharing the specific trait that are also in the population of interest.
5. Estimate the answer based on historic data to the query. Present the numeric value within <answer></answer> tags.
6. Provide a numeric value no matter what.
7. If the number is a percentage, **REPRESENT THIS** as a decimal between 0 and 1.
8. Please give a confidence score on a scale of 0 to 1 for your prediction. The score must be in <score></score> tags

Note: Write down your thought process first, then answer.
