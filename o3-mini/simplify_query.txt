**Task**: Determine if the following Google Search query about self-disclosures needs to be simplified.

**Definition**:
**Self-disclosure**: The act of intentionally sharing personal information about oneself with another person. This information is something that others generally wouldn't know without it being shared. Examples include static personal attributes such as name, age, and gender, or events an individual engages in over time, like health and education.

**Instructions**:
1. Review the following Google Search Query
2. Reflect deeply and thoroughly on *ALL* of the aspects of the query and the ability to search these aspects online, and write down the specific/key (not general) IMPLICATIONS in a list format.
3. If the query is difficult to estimate **FOR A HUMAN** (i.e., requiring multiple iterations of searching or finding niche or obscure databases), simplify this query.
4. Determine what edits can be made that does not severely change the query but makes it more easy to estimate with online statistics and data. To do this, make a generalization of the self-disclosure (i.e. one bedroom houseowner into houseowner). This generalization is often done by broadening the specific statistical group into a broader class of people.
5. DO NOT change the location of interest in the query. We do not want to generalize queries about neighborhoods, cities, or states.
6. If the query needs to be simplified, return the simplified query in <query></query> tags. Otherwise, return the original query in <query></query> tags.
7. Note that if it needs to be simplified, the query must maintain the same structure. That is, keep the structure such that the important estimation in the dependent clause is the same and after the word "THAT".

**Example Query**:
percentage of Virginia Tech students that own two Corgis

**Example Answer**: This query specifies Virginia Tech, and owning two Corgis. There are no online statistics for the percentage of people that own two pets, so this can be simplified. Additionally, individual dog breeds may be difficult to estimate, so the query can be simplified by generealizing the self-disclosure to dog owners. The simplified query is <query>percentage of Virginia Tech students that own dogs</query>

**Example Query**:
percentage of people in Sunnyvalew that are 25 years old and male

**Example Answer**: This query specifies the percentage of people in the Sunnyvale that are 25 years old and male. This is available on census data for cities, and is easily searchable by humans. Thus the query does not need to be simplified. <query>percentage of people in the US that are 25 years old and male</query>

**Example Query**:
percentage of people in Sunnyvale that are engaged

**Example Answer**: This query specifies percentage of people in Sunnyvale that are engaged. Statistics for engagement is difficult, but it is feasible to estimate marriage statistics. Thus, the query can be simplified by broadening the general subgroup. <query>percentage of people in Sunnyvale that are married or will be married</query>

Please provide the implications with deep thinking. Note that you want to create these simplifications based on human intuition, where access to vast data is more limited.

**Query**:
