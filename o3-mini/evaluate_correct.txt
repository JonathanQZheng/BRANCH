**Example Query**:
percentage of people at Georgia Tech that are studying computer science

**Example Answer**: 0.13

**Example Evaluation**: The percentage of people at Georgia Tech that are studying computer science is supposedly 13% Georgia Tech offers over 100 undergraduate majors. Given that the school is more STEM-focused, computer science tends to be a more popular major than other majors at Georgia Tech. However, based on historic enrollment statistics and the diversity of the majors offered, the percentage that people study one major never exceeds over 15%, even for the most popular majors. Thus, the example answer is 13%, which is consistent with historic enrollment data. <answer>Yes</answer>

**Example Query**:

**Example Answer**: 0.75

**Example Evaluation**: The percentage of people at in Sunnyvale who are married that have two kids is supposedly 75%. Based on historic data, the average number of children that families have is around 1.9 kids. However, this does not include single people or children, as they do not count as a kid.

Thus, the percentage of people that have two kids is much lower than 75%. <answer>No</answer>

**Example Query**:

Thus, even though Georgia Tech is a harder school, the rate of people that take a gap semester might be higher, but not as high as 30%. Thus, the percentage of people at Georgia Tech that are taking a gap semester is likely lower than 75%. <answer>No</answer>
