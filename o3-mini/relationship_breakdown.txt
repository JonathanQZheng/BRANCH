**Task**: Determine if relationship status self-disclosures can be broken down into multiple queries for better estimation.

**Definition**:
**Self-disclosure**: The act of intentionally sharing personal information about oneself with another person. This information is something that others generally wouldn't know without it being shared. Examples include static personal attributes such as name, age, and gender, or events an individual engages in over time, like health and education.

**Instructions**:
1. Review the following Google Search Query
2. Reflect deeply and thoroughly on *ALL* of the aspects of the query and the ability to search these aspects online, and write down the specific/key (not general) IMPLICATIONS in a list format.
3. Determine if the following relationship status query mentions a gender of a potential partner (e.g. a wife, a girlfriend, your fiancee).
4. If this exists, break down the query into **TWO** subqueries that divides the gender of the partner.
5. This can be done by creating the first query for broad relationship or family statistics. For example, the disclosure "wife" can be generalized to the percentage of people that are married.
6. Then, specify the number of bins to divide this by. You can estimate this with the expected number of genders. Dividing the query by this number will provide an estimate to the percentage of people that are married to a specific gender, i.e. a wife.
7. If the query **DOES NOT** have a mention of gender, then it cannot be estimated by breaking down the following query. **DO NOT** do any other subquery breakdowns. **RETURN ONLY** the original query in <list></list> tags.
8. Otherwise, return the new queries in a list with <list></list> tags. Surround each query in <answer></answer> tags. Determine the mathematical operation needed to be used to combine the subqueries into the original query, and return this in <math></math> tags.

**Example Query**:
percentage of people that are single

**Example Answer**: This query is asking for the percentage of people that are single. There is no mention of gender of a partner, so this query cannot be broken down further into multiple subqueries.

<list>
<answer>percentage of people that are single</answer>
</list>

**Example Query**:
percentage of people in Cheyenne with girlfriends

**Example Answer**: This query is asking for the percentage of people in Cheyenne with girlfriends. Based on online surveys, it is easier to estimate whether people are in a relationship or not than specifically asking if they have a girlfriend. Thus, it is easier to estimate the more general query of being in a relationship, and dividing this result by the expected (or most common) number of genders. Thus, this query can be decomposed into subqueries. To combine the queries, division is used.

<list>
<answer>percentage of people in Cheyenne in a relationship</answer>
<answer>most common number of genders</answer>
</list>

**Example Query**:
percentage of people with kids in Atlanta that have an ex-husband

**Example Answer**: This query is asking for the percentage of people with kids in Atlanta that have an ex-husband. Based on online surveys, it is easier to estimate whether people are divorced or not than specifically asking if they have a ex-husband. Thus, it is easier to estimate the more general query of being divorced, and dividing this result by the expected (or most common) number of genders. Thus, this query can be decomposed into subqueries. To combine the queries, division is used.

<list>
<answer>percentage of people with kids in Atlanta that are divorced</answer>
<answer>most common number of genders</answer>
</list>

<math>Division</math>

**Example Query**:
percentage of people that are married

**Example Answer**: This query is asking for the percentage of people that are married. There is no mention of gender of a partner, so this query cannot be broken down further into multiple subqueries.

<list>
<answer>percentage of people that are married</answer>
</list>

Please provide the implications with deep thinking, and determine if the query needs to be broken down into subqueries.
